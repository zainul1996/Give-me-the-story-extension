# give-me-the-story-extension

## Description

This project aims to create a google chrome extension that would allow users to highlight article titles and cross check the validity of the title with other sources:

Main features:
- Providing a quick preview of how reliable the article is with a reliablity label
- Shows sources of other articles by reliable/not so reliable sources
	- Reliable sources would hold a higher weight when deciding on the reliability label
- Summary of sources would also be given on a seperate website in order for the user to quickly read them
- Summary of sources would be split into positive and negative sources based on sentiment analysis
- The application would also try to figure out the root article so that users can read the source article itself


Bonus feature:
- Users will be able to highlight texts to find out more about it (definition/wikipedia)

Possible feature:
- Show a change log from the original source to the derived sources to understand how similar/different they are
